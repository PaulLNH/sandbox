## Goals

---

To refactor source code to be clean and meet accessibility standards with the following guidelines.

1. HTML tags are semantically sound.
2. HTML elements follow a logical structure.
3. Images have alt text.
4. CSS follows the same sequential order as the html.
5. There is a relavant title.
6. There are no unnecessary redundancies in code.

## HTML Findings

---

1. All HTML tags were div tags. Replaced all div tags with relevant tags that meet SEO and accessibility standards.
2. No images had alt. text. Added alt text to all images.
3. Added a title.
4. fixed a broken link. "Search Engine optimization."

## CSS Findings

---

1. CSS was out of order: Ordered CSS to follow HTML flow.
2. Repetitive code: Consilidated repetitive CSS. Particurally in the main and aside sections where multiple classes were used for the same styling.

## What I learned in this project

---

- Proper tags are important for SEO and accessibility and should be used instead of div tags for webpages.
- Scout Rule: Always test links and check other people's work to make improvements in possible.
- Code redundancy are common, and there's always ways to make it shorter/cleaner.
